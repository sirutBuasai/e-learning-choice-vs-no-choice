### How to run our tests
1. Be sure that all the experiments are in one directory and that directory is at the same level as main.py. Each of the 4 csv files for each experiment should also be contained in one directory whos name is the experiment ID. Line 213 sets the name of the directory that the experiment data is stored in. We used 'experiment_data/' but change this to whatever yours is.
2. Run main.py with Python! We used Python 3.10.2 for our tests.

2 Datasets will be created after running. They are experimentResults.csv and bhProcedureResults.csv
